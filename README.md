# CS2-Final-Project


4/5/21:
I started working on my final project today. I decided I wanted to create a productivity app to help set up carpools, which is especially relevant for me, who won't have a bus to go home from school starting sophmore year. With the recommendation of my CS2 teacher, I figured using Thunkable would be a good choice as an app development environment. I haven't used this environment before, but looking around, it uses a lot of similar elements from the code.org app development environment however, it seems to contain more powerful features which will make my project better and more interactive. Since I haven't used this environment before, I'll spend the first couple of days getting familiar with the software and possibly designing some of the screens that I will be using for this project. Thankfully this website contains a tutorial which will save a lot of time. I may even be able to start programming by the 7th.
