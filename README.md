# CS2-Final-Project


4/19/21: Day 1
Goal(s): Deciding on my Challenge project
Result: Video Game using Scratch. Two-Player, Battle game. Started Creating some of my Sprites

4/21/21: Day 3
Goals(s): Determine Sprites, Start Programming
Result: I was able to determine the the focus of my video game along with choosing the 4 main sprites that will be used. Focusing on animals, I had designed a snake, bat, penguin, and bear to "battle" against each other in a 2 player game. I was able to program the character selection process that would be used in the beginning of each game along with some basic character movement features. More modifications will be required on movement for later. 
Notes: I spent Day 2 getting more comfortable with the software, as I hadn't used scratch that much. During the programming process, I did run into a small issue. I had difficulty making my sprites appear after the character selection process. It was a small programming error which just required a small amount of debugging to fix. 
Important Lesson: Order of code MATTERS.
