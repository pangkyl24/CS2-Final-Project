# CS2-Final-Project


4/5/21:
I started working on my final project today. I decided I wanted to create a productivity app to help set up carpools, which is especially relevant for me, who won't have a bus to go home from school starting sophmore year. With the recommendation of my CS2 teacher, I figured using Thunkable would be a good choice as an app development environment. I haven't used this environment before, but looking around, it uses a lot of similar elements from the code.org app development environment however, it seems to contain more powerful features which will make my project better and more interactive. Since I haven't used this environment before, I'll spend the first couple of days getting familiar with the software and possibly designing some of the screens that I will be using for this project. Thankfully this website contains a tutorial which will save a lot of time. I may even be able to start programming by the 7th.

I watched the tutorial videos previously and decided on the 5th that I would design screens without planning what my screens would look like. So today I just decided to design my screens in a Notability document and make said screens if time allows.

I came into this project having absolutely no idea what was to come. Every single day I work on this project a new issue arises. And today, it was the issue of not knowing how the screen builder works. More specifically, the "Navigator". The "Navigator" creates screens for you and a navigator window in the app to allow you to switch between screens easily however, I still have no clue how it works. I tried using google but it is still somewhat iffy. I also can't just drag and drop buttons, labels, tabs, etc where I want to put them, I have to adjust numbers and reorder each button, label, tab, etc, in order to move it to where I want. There is also no easy was to modify the size each block is. I haven't even started programming and I am encountering issues. I rather not solve them with brute force, but find an elegant solution to these issues, but with that way it is looking right now, brute force might be the only way. I guess this comes to show how difficult the process is.

I haven't gotten many chances to work on this the past week due to a busy schedule which I will have for the next 2 weeks. I did however finish designing my screens and am currently trying to figure out how to get the navigator to work. Although, I will probably just not use it.
